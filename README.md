# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Cyclistic


Introduction

Demonstrated in this case study are the skills that I have learned in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course. I will use these skills to complete the tasks of a data analyst working for the fictional bike-share company Cyclistic. Following the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, I will complete the business task presented to me and help the company make data-driven decisions.


Scenario

The Cyclistic Director of Marketing, Lily Moreno, believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must apporove our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
