# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Cyclistic


Introduction
Demonstrated in this case study are the skills that I have learned in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course. I will use these skills to complete the tasks of a data analyst working for the fictional bike-share company Cyclistic. Following the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, I will complete the business task presented to me and help the company make data-driven decisions.
